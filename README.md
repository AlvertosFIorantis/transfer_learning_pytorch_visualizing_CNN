# transfer_learning_pytorch_visualizing_CNN
transfer learning from pytorch and visualising all the CNN 
First step is to use the google API to download photos for the two classes that we would like to classify.
Next step is to transfer the phots to the respective subfolders.
Using the pre-trained RSNET50 model from pytorch we can easily create a binary classification model using less than 500 images.
The final part of the script prints out all the CNN in order to visually understand how the model works under the hood
